		<h1>WELCOME TO KRILLEN DIARY</h1>
		<p>
			Today was yet another day filled with adventure, excitement, and a dash of danger, just another day in the life of a Z Fighter!<br>
			My name is Krillin, and I thought it would be a great idea to start documenting my experiences as one of Earth's mightiest defenders.

		<h3>DAY 1: Who the hell is this long hair guy?</h3>
		<hr color="purple", size="3">
		<p>
			Hold onto your senzu beans,<br>
			because today took an unexpected detour into the world of intergalactic family reunions – Saiyan style! So, picture this: Goku and I were training, minding our own business, when out of nowhere, a spaceship lands with the grace of a cow on roller skates. And who steps out? None other than Raditz, Goku's long-lost brother, or as I like to call him, Mr. "I-Just-Came-to-Drop-a-Truth-Bomb."
		</p>
		<h4>The result which was really...uhh :</h4>
		<p>
			This wasn't just any takedown. It was like a tag-team match from the heavens. Piccolo zapped Raditz with his Special Beam Cannon – I guess Saiyan-family reunions really aren't his thing. Meanwhile, Goku held Raditz down, and brace yourself, Diary, he took the hit, too! Talk about a double whammy.
		</p>
		<h5>Damn it Piccolo, you Makankosappo'ed our friend Goku and took his son WTF!!</h5>
